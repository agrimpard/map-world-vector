## World map vector

This world map is a combination of classic tiles with vector overlays (SVG) based on Leaflet.
The objective is to display an interactive map, in color, as simply as possible, as aesthetically as possible, with open source content.

## Goal

The objective is to try to reproduce a map that I like very much consultable on ArcGIS with the geopolitical background map.

## Result

Here is the rendering I get for the moment !
